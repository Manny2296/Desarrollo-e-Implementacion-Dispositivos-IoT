# Design and development of IOT devices for SMART HOME

The development of IoT devices is basically the connection of a big amount of objects through intenet. Consequently, the implementation of these devices has evolved in the last years being used in different scenarios like home, manufacturing, industrial, among others. Currently, these IoT devices are developed without a very clear security perspective making them attractive for cyber attacks which benefit the fact that these device do not pose a proper protection level. 

As every day there are more IoT devices for smart home, a cyber attack over them could imply a significant impact embracing information leakage, deny of service or proccess activies modification. In the current project, we will focus in the analisys and evaluation of security breaches in smart home devices, understanding the buildging process of a general purpose IoT device, so it can be possible to assure that process and achieve IoT devices with high fiability that protect the information that they receive or transmit.

In this repo you can find the building process of a set of smart home IoT devices, starting with a 1) IoT device for management of media content - OSMC (Open source Media Center) 2) IoT device for magement of lights and heating 3) IoT device for heart pulse monitoring - ECG (Electrocardiogram).

Documentation related with the design and security analysis for each IoT device is also provided.
